      "Find SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Packages in Tenant and Site Collection App Catalogs which will help maintain oversight of SPFx installation, ensuring they are up-to-date and compliant. The script was particularly useful in pinpointing sites within the tenant where third-party applications, specifically an analytics SPFx component, were deployed. This was crucial for ensuring that data collection was confined to designated sites, such as the intranet in my case study."
