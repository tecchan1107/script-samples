       "Managing permissions in SharePoint is a critical aspect of maintaining data security and compliance within organisations. However, as SharePoint environments grow in complexity, manually auditing and managing permissions becomes increasingly challenging.Copilot for Microsoft m365 can access data from all the tenant, whether itâ€™s Outlook emails, Teams chats and meetings, SharePoint and OneDrive. SharePoint is where all most documents, videos, and more are stored. Hence permission audit across sensitive sites to ensure 'Least privilege' is a must to avoid data leak while using Copilot for Microsoft m365 which makes it easier to discover content through prompts."
