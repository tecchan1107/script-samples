A classic site however can host modern pages which enable great end user experiences. You can find inspiration via the SharePoint Look Book as it allows you to discover the modern experiences you can build with SharePoint in Office 365. SharePoint PnP Modernization is part of the PnP Framework and PnP PowerShell to bring page transformation capabilities",
