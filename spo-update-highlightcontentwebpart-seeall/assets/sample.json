    "longDescription": ["Recently, I encountered an issue with the 'Show title and commands' toggle in the out-of-the-box Highlighted Content web part. It stopped working on both my development and customer tenant. While awaiting a resolution from Microsoft, I decided to find a workaround. That's when the PnP PowerShell cmdlet `Set-PnPPageWebPart` came to the rescue. The solution involves updating the PropertiesJson property of the web part."
